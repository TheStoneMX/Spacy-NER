Streamline Resume Processing with Spacy NER

Resumes come in various formats, and xyz.com serves as a platform that hosts these diverse resumes, showcasing them to hiring managers from Fortune 500 companies. At present, the process they use is highly labor-intensive. For instance, when someone submits a resume on the website, a staff member manually reviews it and extracts essential information such as name, job title, workplace, and more.

This process is challenging due to the sheer volume of resumes uploaded, with limited personnel available to handle them. Consequently, this has become a pressing issue.

xyz.com has enlisted our help in developing a resume parser that can efficiently extract crucial data from resumes using machine learning. They have supplied us with a dataset (sourced from Dataturks) containing tagged information to identify specific elements within each resume, such as job title, name, location, and skills. This data is provided in a JSON file format, and the tagged fields include:

a) Location
b) Job Title
c) Name
d) Years of Experience
e) College
f) Degree
g) Graduation Year
h) Companies Worked At
i) Email Address

Our task is to develop an NLP-powered machine learning module that can accurately identify and extract this information from submitted resumes.
